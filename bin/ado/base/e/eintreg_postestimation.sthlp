{title:predict}

{pstd}
Predictions after {cmd:eintreg} and {cmd:xteintreg} are described in

            {helpb eintreg predict:[ERM] eintreg predict}       predict after eintreg and xteintreg
            {helpb erm predict treatment:[ERM] predict treatment}     predict for treatment statistics
            {helpb erm predict advanced:[ERM] predict advanced}      predictâ€™s advanced features

{pstd}
{helpb eintreg predict:[ERM] eintreg predict} describes the most commonly used
predictions.  If you fit a model with treatment effects, predictions
specifically related to these models are detailed in
{helpb erm predict treatment:[ERM] predict treatment}.
{helpb erm predict advanced:[ERM] predict advanced} describes less commonly
used predictions, such as predictions of outcomes in auxiliary equations.
