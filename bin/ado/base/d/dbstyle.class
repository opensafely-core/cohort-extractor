// It would be nice to inherit from style because it would allow the dbstyle
// to be edited interactively like any other style.  However, it sets up a
// recursive ownership since style inherits from object.  So, dbstyle cannot
// inherit from style or object and thus cannot be edited using
// object.dialog_box.
