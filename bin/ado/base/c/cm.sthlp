{pstd}
Choice models (CM) are models for data with outcomes that are choices.  The
choices are selected by a decision maker, such as a person or a business, from
a set of possible alternatives.  For instance, we could model choices made by
consumers who select a breakfast cereal from several different brands.  Or we
could model choices made by businesses who chose whether to buy TV, radio,
Internet, or newspaper advertising.

{pstd}
Models for choice data come in two varieties -- models for discrete choices
and models for rank-ordered alternatives.  When each individual selects a
single alternative, say, he or she purchases one box of cereal, the data are
discrete choice data.  When each individual ranks the choices, say, he or she
orders cereals from most favorite to least favorite, the data are rank-ordered
data.  Stata has commands for fitting both discrete choice models and
rank-ordered models.
