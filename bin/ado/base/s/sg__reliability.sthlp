{pstd}
Reliability is measured as the fraction of variance that is not due to
measurement error.  The reliability is specified by entering the reliability
as a fraction or percent in the dialog field.  For instance, you can enter
either {cmd:.8} or {cmd:80%} to indicate that 80% of the variance is not due
to measurement error.
