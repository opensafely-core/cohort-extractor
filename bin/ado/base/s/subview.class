/*                                  subview

	Parent class for sub-views.  Does not have any size or stretch
	information because this is already set in the current gdi alphas and
	betas for sub views

	In general, classes that inherit from subview and define their own
	.new should invoke Super.setstyle to process style() and
	styleref() options.
