{opt showreffects} and
{opth showreffects:(bayesian_postestimation##bayesian_post_reref:reref)}
are for use after multilevel models, and they specify that the results for all
or a list {it:reref} of random-effects parameters be provided in addition to
other model parameters.  By default, all random-effects parameters are
excluded from the results to conserve computation time.
