This module provides the methods for making a study definition

These methods don't *do* anything; they just return their name and arguments.
This provides a friendlier API than having to build some big nested data
structure by hand and means we can make use of autocomplete, docstrings etc to
make it a bit more discoverable.

            is `True` (i.e. the value returned is the minimum measurement taken on a single day).

        ##### Cluster RCTs

        Support is currently available for randomised controlled trials clustered at
        practice level (though we are also happy to add support for RCTs randomised
        at person-level).

        A series of data files supplied by the trialists will be imported into
        OpenSAFELY; this will indicate which practices are enrolled, their assignment
        to an intervention group, and any other relevant practice properties or data
        gathered as part of the RCT outside of OpenSAFELY (e.g. number of GPs/nurses,
        number of practice visits made).

        These RCT variables are only available for use by the researchers officially
        nominated by the responsible research group.

        There is special syntax for accessing this data using the `returning` argument:

            rct__{trial_name}__{property_name}

        (Note the double underscores separating `rct`, trial name and property name.)

        For example, for a trial called `germdefence` which has a property called
        `deprivation_pctile`, a variable can be created with:

            practice_deprivation_pctile=patients.registered_practice_as_of(
                "2020-01-01",
                returning="rct__germdefence__deprivation_pctile",
                return_expectations={
                    "rate": "universal",
                    "category": {
                        "ratios": {
                            "1": 0.5,
                            "2": 0.5
                        },
                    },
                },
            )

        The special property `enrolled` is a boolean indicating whether the practice
        was enrolled in the trial. It will be 1 for all intervention AND control practices
        and 0 for any practices which are not part of the trial.

        All other properties are returned as strings, exactly as supplied by the
        trialists.  For the `germdefence` trial the available properties are:

            trial_arm
            av_rooms_per_house
            deprivation_pctile
            group_mean_behaviour_mean
            group_mean_intention_mean
            hand_behav_practice_mean
            hand_intent_practice_mean
            imd_decile
            intcon
            meanage
            medianage
            minority_ethnic_total
            n_completers_hw_behav
            n_completers_ri_behav
            n_completers_ri_intent
            n_engaged_pages_viewed_mean_mean
            n_engaged_visits_mean
            n_goalsetting_completers_per_practice
            n_pages_viewed_mean
            n_times_visited_mean
            n_visits_practice
            prop_engaged_visits
            total_visit_time_mean

    The data resulting from the study definition will be at patient level as usual
    and therefore practice variables will be repeated many times for each practice,
    and should be aggregated in a later analysis step.

    Finds COVID lab test results recorded in SGSS (Second Generation
    Surveillance System).

    Please note that all dates used here are "specimen dates" (i.e. the date
    the specimen was taken), rather than the date the lab result was obtained.

    It's important to note that data is supplied in two separate datasets: an
    "Earliest Specimen" dataset and an "All Tests" dataset.

    ###  Earliest Specimen Dataset

    Where a patient has multiple positive tests, SGSS groups these into
    "episodes" (referred to as "Organism-Patient-Illness-Episodes"). Each
    pathogen has a maximum episode duration (usually 2 weeks) and unless
    positive tests are separated by longer than this period they are assumed to
    be the same episode of illness.  The specimen date recorded is the
    *earliest* positive specimen within the episode.

    For SARS-CoV-2 the episode length has been set to infinity, meaning that
    once a patient has tested positive every positive test will be part of the
    same episode and record the same specimen date.

    This means that using `find_last_match_in_period` is pointless when
    querying for positive results as only one date will ever be recorded and it
    will be the earliest.

    Our original assumption, though the documentation didn't state either way,
    is that every negative result would be treated as unique. However this does
    not appear to be the case as though some patients do have multiple negative
    tests in this dataset, the number is far too small to be realistic.

    Information about the SARS-CoV-2 episode length was via email from someone
    at the National Infection Service:

        The COVID-19 episode length in SGSS was set to indefinite, so all
        COVID-19 records from a single patient will be classified as one
        episode. This may change, but is set as it is due to limited
        information around re-infection and virus clearance.

    ### All Tests Dataset

    This dataset is not subject to the same restriction as above and we expect
    each individual test result (postive or negative) to appear in this
    regardless of whether they are considered as within the same infection
    episode. In an ideal world we could use just this dataset, but there are
    some fields we need (e.g. Case Category) which are only supplied on the
    "earliest specimen" dataset.

    ### S-Gene Target Failure

    Using the `returning="s_gene_target_failure"` option provides additional
    output from PCR tests results which can be used as a proxy for the presence
    of certain Variants of Concern.

    Possible values are "", "0", "1", "9"

    Definitions (from email from PHE)

        1: Isolate with confirmed SGTF
        Undetectable S gene; CT value (CH3) =0
        Detectable ORF1ab gene; CT value (CH2) <=30 and >0
        Detectable N gene; CT value (CH1) <=30 and >0

        0: S gene detected
        Detectable S gene (CH3>0)
        Detectable y ORF1ab CT value (CH1) <=30 and >0
        Detectable N gene CT value (CH2) <=30 and >0

        9: Cannot be classified

        Null are where the target is not S Gene. I think LFTs are currently
        also coming across as 9 so will need to review those to null as well as
        clearly this is a PCR only variable.

    ### Case Category (type of test used)

    Using the `returning="case_category"` option (only available on positive,
    earliest specimen date results) reports whether the test was a Lateral Flow
    or PCR test. Possible values are:

        "LFT_Only", "PCR_Only", "LFT_WithPCR"

    ### Variant

    The `returning="variant"` option (only available in the "All Tests" data)
    returns details on specific SARS-CoV-2 variants detected. Possible values
    include, but are not limited to:

        B.1.617.2
        VOC-21JAN-02
        VUI-21FEB-04
        P.1
        E484K
        B.1.1.7+E484K
        No VOC detected
        Sequencing Failed
        Undetermined
        Undetermined + e484k

    The `returning="variant_detection_method"` options returns possible values:

        "Reflex Assay" and "Private Lab Sequencing"

    ### Symptomatic

    The `returning="symptomatic"` option (only available in the "All Tests" data)
    returns details on whether patients are symptomatic of SARS-CoV-2 or not. This
    option is available regardless of the test result outcome.

    Possible values are "", "Y", "N".

    ### Number of Tests

    The `returning="number_of_matches_in_period"` option (only available in the "All Tests" data)
    returns a count of the number of tests a patient has had in the defined time period.

    It is used with `test_result` which must be set as "positive", "negative" or "any".
    `returning="number_of_matches_in_period"` can therefore be used to return the number of
    positive, negative or all tests.

        restrict_to_earliest_specimen_date: a boolean indicating whether to use
            the "earliest specimen" or "all tests" dataset (see above). True by

            * `number_of_matches_in_period` (see above)

            year is less disclosive than a date with day, month and year.

        Two variables are created. One called `first_tested_for_covid` is the
        first date that a patient has a covid test never mind the result. The
        second called `first_positive_test_date` is the first date that a
