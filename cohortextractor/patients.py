    Finds lab test results recorded in SGSS (Second Generation Surveillance
    System). Only SARS-CoV-2 results are included in our data extract so this
    will throw an error if the specified pathogen is anything other than
    "SARS-CoV-2".

    `test_result` must be one of: "positive", "negative" or "any"

    The date field used is the date the specimen was taken, rather than the
    date of the lab result.

    There's an important caveat here: where a patient has multiple positive
    tests, SGSS groups these into "episodes" (referred to as
    "Organism-Patient-Illness-Episodes"). Each pathogen has a maximum episode
    duration (usually 2 weeks) and unless positive tests are separated by
    longer than this period they are assumed to be the same episode of illness.
    The specimen date recorded is the *earliest* positive specimen within the
    episode.

    For SARS-CoV-2 the episode length has been set to infinity, meaning that
    once a patient has tested positive every positive test will be part of the
    same episode and record the same specimen date.

    This means that using `find_last_match_in_period` is pointless when
    querying for positive results as only one date will ever be recorded and it
    will be the earliest.

    Our natural assumption, though it doesn't seem to be explicity stated in
    the documentation, is that every negative result is treated as unique.

    For more detail on SGSS in general see:
    https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/739854/PHE_Laboratory_Reporting_Guidelines.pdf

    Information about the SARS-CoV-2 episode length was via email from someone
    at the National Infection Service:

        The COVID-19 episode length in SGSS was set to indefinite, so all
        COVID-19 records from a single patient will be classified as one
        episode. This may change, but is set as it is due to limited
